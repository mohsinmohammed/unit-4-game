### Crystals Collector Game

## Project Description:

Crystals collector game is built with Jquery. The objective of the game is to match player score to a random number which is displayed. Player's score starts at zero and it goes up when crystal images are clicked. Each click on the crystal adds specific number of points to the score. Player wins the game when the score matches the random number. The crystals can be clicked any number of times, but player loses the game when the score goes higher than the random target number. The game restarts when the player wins or loses. Each game starts with a new target random number and new hidden crystal values.
